<center>We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the Traditional Custodians of the land and waters of Australia. We also acknowledge the Nyoongar Wadjuk, Ngunnawal and Kaurna Elders, their people and their land upon which our team is located and seek their wisdom and guidance in our work to improve the health and development of Indigenous communities.</center>

Black Ochre Data Labs is a multidisciplinary research team working towards improving generational health for all through Indigenous-led genomic sciences. The group was established in 2022 under the leadership of Professor Alex Brown and is jointly funded by the Telethon Kids Institute (Nyoongar Wadjuk/Perth) and Australian National University (Ngunnawal/Canberra). The team is predominantly located across the Adelaide and Perth offices of the Telethon Kids Institute.
