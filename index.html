Black Ochre Data Labs is a multidisciplinary research team working towards improving generational health for all through Indigenous-led genomic sciences. The group was established in 2022 under the leadership of Professor Alex Brown and is jointly funded by the Telethon Kids Institute (Nyoongar Wadjuk/Perth) and Australian National University (Ngunnawal/Canberra). The team is located across the Kaurna/Adelaide and Nyoongar Wadjuk/Perth offices of the Telethon Kids Institute.
