subtitle: An Indigenous Genomics research team

<p><center><i>We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the Traditional Custodians of the land and waters of Australia. We also acknowledge the Kaurna, Nyoongar Wadjuk and Ngunnawal Elders, their people and their land upon which our team is located and seek their wisdom and guidance in our work to improve the health and development of Indigenous communities.</i></center></p>

<p>Black Ochre Data Labs is a multidisciplinary research team working to reduce health inequality through the power of genomics. With the use of genomic technologies, we can look at our DNA for answers about health conditions like Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), heart disease and cancer. With this new knowledge we hope to understand why some people and families develop these conditions more than others, or why they might develop more severe complications. We can use this information to develop Precision Medicine approaches to improve patient care and health outcomes.</p>

<p>The group was established in 2022 under the leadership of Professor Alex Brown and is jointly funded by the <a href="https://www.telethonkids.org.au/our-research/chronic-and-severe-diseases/precision-health/indigenous-genomics/">Telethon Kids Institute</a> and <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/">Australian National University</a>. The team is located in the Tarndanya/Adelaide (Kaurna Country) and Boorloo/Perth (Whadjuk Noongar Country) offices of the Telethon Kids Institute.</p>
